# Web Scraping Challenge
The Mission to Mars folder in this repository contains a jupyter notebook, python file, html file, and css file all of which combine to scrape data from websites which host information about Mars and use that scraped data to create my own website about Mars.

Screenshots of the website are in the Screenshots folder.
